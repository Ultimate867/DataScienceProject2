				<p> JUNIOR PERALTA contributed to the project by analizing the numbers in sales of the most famous
				video game consoles and the number of copies for each famous franchise sold over the years. This data will be used to prove the hypothesis that
				the sales of certain consoles increased as well as the demand for the most famous franchises played on those consoles. To show I will use 
				plots and histograms to display their changes in sales over the last 3 decades. </p>

				<p> Data Set #1 involves the numbers of the most famous video game franchise sales that had sold at least 5 million copies over 
				the last 3 decades collected from WIKIPEDIA page for the best selling franchises. The following images show the bar graphs and 
				scatter plots of franchise and console sales</p>
				
				<p> Data Set #2 involves the sales of the most famous video game consoles from the wikipedia page for the best selling video game comsoles. </p>
				
				<p>Data sets #3 - #8 show the popular genres based on based on the following plots from statista. It shows us genres on high demand.
				"What are the gainful genres in video game?" This part of the project is analysing data on video game genres like shooter, action, role-playing, 
				sport games, adventure, fighting, strategy, racing and others. For the answer of the question "what are the gainful genres in video game?", 
				we used datasets related to video game genres to analyse from statista.</p>

					<p>This image shows that the franchises with the most sales are the ones that started from 1980 to 1985. As we move forward in the 
					chronological order, we see the numbers of sales seems to alternate and ends with the lowest number in 2005</p>

					<p>This scatter plot illustrated the same points recorded in the graph above. its use will be to show the different

					'Game_Boy_Advance"', 'Nintendo_Entertainment_System"', 'Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System"', 'Nintendo_64"', 'Sega_Genesis"', 
					'Atari_2600"', 'Xbox_(console)"', 'GameCube"', 'Wii_U"', 'Master_System"', 'Sega_Game_Gear"', 'TurboGrafx-16"', 'Sega_Saturn"',

					<p>The following images show the bar graphs and scatter plots of the franchise and console sales</p>
					
					<p> In conclusion, the hypothesis is false. The franchises sold in the lowest selling systems only have large numbers because
					they release at the beginning of the 1980s and have continuously sold multiple sequels and different console versions of the games.
					
					For example, even through the Mario Franchise has over 528 million sold copies, these are not sold on Playstation 2 which is the most
					console. All these franchises that vary in variety of genre and gaming console, these have their sales up to the numerous games per
					franchise, leading up to a larger total number sales regardless of the number of respective console sales.

				<p> Djakaridia Diabagate: My contribution in the second part of the project: video game sales based on genre. To answer the 
				question "what is the most profitable video game genre, I scraped datasets and analysed them. At the end of those studies, I found 
				the genres that are the most profitable: Shooter, Sport and Strategy."</p>
